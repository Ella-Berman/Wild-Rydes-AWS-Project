Used AWS services to deploy a dynamic serverless web application that allows users to request an account, 
confirm their account via email, sign in to the website, and request rides on an interactive map. 
I used S3 to host a static web app, Cognito to authenticate and manage users, Lambda, IAM, and DynamoDB 
to build a serverless backend, and API Gateway to deploy a RESTful API.
